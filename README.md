# LitFit

## Overview
LitFit is an application that serves to monetize and unveil the sub-retail culture of Thrifting. The application allows local consumers to showcase their local finds (fits), review thrift stores, and comment on other users' visuals. Data implicates 67% of consumers affiliate "second-hand" retail as lesser quality. The point of the application is to disrupt the general perception of thrift shopping; allowing local consumers to view potential pieces they could add to their wardrobe.  The app will integrate technical tools such as HTML, CSS, React and React Hooks. The app's technical skeleton will be backed by the M.E.R.N stack.  
## Technical Chanlleges and Methods
The technical skeleton of the application was pre-planned, which alleviated the need to extensively research technical tools.  To organize my work, I created separate repositories for the front end and backend. The first challenge I encountered was my use of React Hooks, unsurprisingly It took me a while to understand the exact syntax to script to fulfill my API request. Another memorable challenge I faced was communicating data from the input boxes to the API. I resolved this issue by utilizing Postman.com; a phenomenal API development tool that allows one to verify what data is being linked to the API.  Lastly, I utilized Bootstrap to design the application. 
## Design Logic
Producing the skin of the application with user accessibility is a welcomed challenged. I often break the process down into four figures. Utilize the figures below to follow the process. Figure 1 through 4 illustrates the gradual manifestation of the applications appearance. For example, in Figure 2 I allocated a geographic visual of the application to create a sense of local engagement in the platform. I also added different spaces for input boxes and resulting fits; I wanted to prioritize minimalistic distractions from the userâ€™s work.
